# Python Backdoor
Able to connect and run commands from a remote computer.
Do not use on anyone without their consent

# How to use
You must have python installed, the [server.py](server.py) file is what the remote user uses to send the commands, and the [client.py](client.py) recives them.
You must change the port and ip varable in both files to make it connect to your own computers.
